				<br>
				From Playmobil, Magic: The Gathering and Warhammer, I've always loved playing games and imagining new worlds.
				<br><br>				
				Even before studying Computer Science, I knew I wanted to build a career creating immersive experiences limited only by imagination. That passion led me to pursue a Master's degree in Game Development immediately after earning my degree.
				<br><br>
				Currently, I'm part of my biggest game project: <b>Fatal: Unleashed Darkness</b>, where I lead the programming team and contribute to the game design.
				<br><br>
				Over the years, I've built more than 10 games from scratch, often participating in game jams along the way. Each project has been a valuable lesson in game design, team collaboration, art, and development.
